question five
One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile.
In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript
Tags can self-close in JSX. Self-closing tags in HTML can self-close without the slash before the right angle bracket, that is <br /> could work as <br>. But in JSX, you need to include the slash
question six
Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.
